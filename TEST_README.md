# Test Case Documentation

## Introduction

This project contains a set of test cases for a game developed using the Pygame library. The purpose of these test cases is to ensure that the game functions as expected.

## Test Case Description

### Pygame Initialization

This test case checks if the Pygame library is properly initialized. The expected outcome is that the `pygame.init()` function is called once.

### Screen Creation

This test case checks if the game screen is properly created. The expected outcome is that the `pygame.display.set_mode()` function is called with the correct arguments.

### Image Loading

This test case checks if the game images are properly loaded. The expected outcome is that the `pygame.image.load()` function is called with the correct arguments.

### Sound Loading

This test case checks if the game sounds are properly loaded. The expected outcome is that the `pygame.mixer.music.load()` function is called with the correct arguments.

### Sound Playing

This test case checks if the game sounds are properly played. The expected outcome is that the `pygame.mixer.music.play()` function is called.

## Resources Used

The following resources are used in these test cases:

- **unittest**: A built-in Python library used for testing Python code.
- **pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
- **unittest.mock**: A Python library used for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system under test and make assertions about how they have been used.

## Justification for Resources

The `unittest` and `unittest.mock` libraries were chosen for their extensive support for testing in Python. They provide a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests, making them ideal for our needs.

The `pygame` library was chosen for its extensive support for game development in Python. It provides a wide range of functionalities for creating games, including functionalities for graphics, sound, and input handling.
